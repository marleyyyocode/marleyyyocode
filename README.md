### 💡 GitHub Tips

#### How to Reopen a Closed (Deleted) Branch

If you deleted a branch after closing/merging a pull request, you can restore it directly on GitHub:

1. Go to the **Pull Requests** tab of the repository.
2. Click on **Closed** to see closed pull requests.
3. Open the pull request that was on the deleted branch.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click **Restore branch**.

Alternatively, if you know the branch's last commit SHA, you can recreate it via the command line:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name> <last-commit-sha>
git push origin <branch-name>
```

> **Note:** GitHub keeps deleted branch data for a period of time, so restoration is usually possible soon after deletion.
